# gl-matrix-wasm

Port gl-matrix to webassembly.

## Goals

1. Support all functions in gl-matrix.
2. Write by pure rust without any third-part dependencies.
3. 27K(gzip, spilt files) / 35K (gzip, one js file).
4. Full unit tests as same as gl-matrix's.

## Usage

First, install it

```shell
npm i gl-matrix-wasm -s
```

### One Js file

### Split files

## Development
